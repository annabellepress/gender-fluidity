	<h1>Getting Familiar with Gender Fluidiy</h1>
	<span class="subtitle">Mary Retta</span>
	<br><span class="subtitle">September 2019</span>

	<h2>What is Gender Fluidity?</h2>
	<p>Let’s define a few terms. Cisgender means a person’s gender identity matches the sex—female or male—designated on their original birth certificate. Gender fluidity refers to change over time in a person’s gender expression or gender identity, or both. That change might be in expression, but not identity, or in identity, but not expression. Or both expression and identity might change together.</p>

	<h2>What does Non-Binary mean?</h2>
	<p>The dictionary defines “non-binary” as something that is “not consisting of, indicating, or involving two.” While the term most commonly refers to someone’s gender identity, it can also be applied to many other things. Non-binary or gender-neutral clothing, for instance, is a growing industry appreciated by many, including cisgender folks.</p>

	<p>But the term “non-binary” is most commonly used to describe someone’s gender identity when they do not identify within the traditional categories of male or female. “The term ‘non-binary’ directly references the gender binary, or the idea that there are only two categories of gender experience,” said Himes. “But non-binary individuals do not operate within that socially constructed reality.”</p>
	
	<p>“I identify as non-binary because I do not identify with either gender,” said Rui, a 19 year-old college student in New Jersey.</p>

	<h2>What does Gender Non-Conforming mean?</h2>
	<p>Broadly, “gender non-conforming” defines people who have a gender expression that does not conform to traditional gender norms. Similar to both “non-binary” and “genderqueer,” “gender non-conforming” is also often used as an umbrella term—although it is sometimes also used to refer to people who identify as cis-gender but who dress or behave in ways that defy gender stereotypes.</p>
	
	<p>“The term says, ‘I am expected to be in this box, but I am not going to be in the box because I’m not going to conform to the expectations that are set for me,’” Himes said.
	Others interpret it with added nuance. “In contrast [to ‘genderqueer’], I conceptualize being gender non-conforming as more rooted in how you’re perceived by others,” Cohen added, “and I tend to use that word mostly in cis spaces, as it invites less questions and is easier for people to understand.”</p>
	
	<p>“Non-binary,” “genderqueer,” and “gender non-conforming” are just three of many words with which people outside of the gender binary identify. Others include “third-gender,” “genderfluid,” “two-spirit,” “pangender,” and “agender”—each having their own inflections of meaning.</p>

	<h2>What does Gender Queer mean?</h2>
	<p>According to a history of the term published in them., “genderqueer” originated in activist circles in the 1990s and grew in commonality over the last three or so decades.</p>
	
	<p>“To me, ‘genderqueer’ represents a queering of gender, so to speak,” said Laura A. Jacobs, a psychotherapist who specializes in trans and gender non-binary issues, LGBTQ issues, and other forms of gender and sexual diversity. “It’s a deliberate playing with gender in a very political sense, and being provocative around gender norms to highlight the gender stereotypes of our culture. It is also how I identify.”</p>

	<p>Cyrus Cohen, who lives in New York City and identifies as non-binary, considers their identity to be a form of genderqueerness. “I define ‘genderqueer’ as an umbrella term that just means ‘not cisgender,’” they said.</p>

	<p>Rui, however, sees it differently: “I don’t use the term ‘genderqueer’ because, to in my opinion, that implies more of an oscillation between genders.”</p>

	<h2>Are Non-Binary, Gender Non-Conforming, and Gender Queer all the same?</h2>
	<p>“These are all terms that have come out of personal experience,” said Lou Himes, a non-binary Psy-D and Liscenced Clinical psychologist based in New York City. That means there are no concrete definitions to go by. Plus, these terms are relatively new to academia, medicine, and mainstream discourse. The beauty of this is that each person can interpret their differences for themselves and identify with the one that resonates most with them.</p>
	
	<p>There are many people who identify with all of these terms and use them interchangeably, and there are many people primarily or solely identify with only one of these terms. Interpretations about the specific differences between them vary. But one thing always remains true: If you are going to refer to someone’s identity, you should always ask what label they prefer, and stick to that one.</p>

	<h1>It's Not in Your Head: The History and Science of Gender Fluidity</h1>
	<span class="subtitle">Laura McGuire</span>
	<br><span class="subtitle">July 2018</span>

	<p>At some point in your early childhood, a well-meaning parent or teacher probably sat you down and shared what they believed to be the simple facts of life—that the world was made of boys and girls. Boys have penises and girls have vaginas, they said, and they made you think it was really that simple. We see the same sentiment reiterated in political debates over “bathroom bills” and job protection acts being contested in state and local governments across the country. Certain politicians and concerned citizens are genuinely confused to hear LGBTQ advocates and allies inform them that both gender and sex are more nuanced than they know.</p>

	<p>Sadly, to this day, one of the most commonly Googled questions cis/hetero people ask about the trans community is: “Is being trans a mental illness or a reaction to trauma?” For folks coming to terms with their identity and trying to break free from the confines that previously held them back, this misconception can be deeply disheartening and cruel. The best way to combat ignorance and myths about gender is with education and information. Here are some main points to put gender fluidity and trans identity in context.</p>

	<h2>Even the APA Knows Better</h2>
	<p>Gender identity issues have been studied in the Western World since the mid-1800s. In the 1950s, the first gender confirmation surgeries and medical interventions were performed on a select few individuals, and awareness from the psychological community increased. It wasn’t until 1980 that the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) put a label on gender identity incongruence in patients. They listed it as “Gender Identity Disorder” and added subcategories to this diagnosis. This lead many in the general public to believe that being transgender was a problematic and deviant behavior, a misconception still currently being propagated by many politicians. The latest DSM categorizes a range of gender identity and presentation experiences under the title of “Gender Dysphoria,” dysphoria meaning a state of unease or dissatisfaction. This transition illustrates the psychiatric community’s evolution in its understanding of gender identity issues not as illness, but as states of anguish for those unable to identify and present as their true gender.</p>

	<p>o understand what this all means, we need to dig deeper into the historical and cultural factors that play into this debate. To begin with, we must understand that the terms “sex” and “gender” are not interchangeable, nor are they the same. Sex is a biological characteristic based on chromosomal factors and sex characteristics such as genitals. Gender is a social construct and refers to how an individual navigates the world through identity (pronouns, names, etc.), how we dress and our mannerisms (feminine, masculine), and how we see ourselves. Often, these two get mixed up, resulting in the misconception that our body parts decide our gender.</p>

	<h2>Chromosomes Don’t Like Binaries</h2>
	<p>Some folks (heterosexual and LGB) continue to argue that there shouldn’t be a difference between a person’s sex and gender—that, in fact, they must be one and the same. The problem with this argument is twofold. 1. There are dozens of variations in chromosomes. 2. The idea of only two genders is a modern-day creation. While it is most common for people to be born with either an XX pair of chromosomes (female) or XY (male), it has been well-documented that many other clear variations (XXX, XXY, XYY, XXYY) and slighter variations of the X and Y combinations are more common than many people understand. What this means is, even if sex decided our gender, there are far more than two sexes.</p>

	<h2>The Gender Binary is a Modern Creation</h2>
	<p>From a cultural and historical perspective, the gender binary is a relatively new concept. However, because of Judeo-Christian colonization, there are theories that this binary has existed since the dawn of time. When missionaries landed around the globe and saw that a majority of indigenous cultures had three or more genders, they sought to extinguish these beliefs and practices. Now, more indigenous activists are speaking up and reclaiming the terms once used for their gender fluid tribal members, also known as two-spirit people. The term “two-spirit” refers to the belief that LGBTQ people have two spirits living inside them, an experience that allows them to view the world holistically and to be closer to the divine. The Navajo call them nádleehí. In Siberia, the Chukchi are tribal shaman whose third gender identity designates them as spiritual leaders within their community. In the Maori cultures of New Zealand, they are the wakawahine. In the Democratic Republic of the Congo, they are called the bangala and are said to possess unique abilities to solve crimes, as they see the world from multiple angles. We see historical evidence of third gendrs and gender fluid people on every continent were not only tolerated, but celebrated.</p>

	<p>Beyond the biological, cultural, and historical facts that gender is a spectrum, there are also benefits to embracing gender fluidity. Numerous studies have shown how strict gender roles can become toxic—from male entitlement over female bodies, unequal pay, physical stress stemming from unevenly distributed household labor, to the disbelief of male victims of sexual assault, the problems are seemingly endless. The modern Western idea that gender has to fit into constricting and separate boxes benefits few and harms many. Some fear this means LGBTQ advocates are pushing for a world where no one can have a gender identity and everyone is forced to be androgynous. This is simply not true. LGBTQ activists are simply advocating for personal and societal freedom and growth, which has the potential to benefit everyone.</p>

	<p>When a person comes out as transgender, gender fluid, or genderqueer, they are following in a lineage that was and is sacred in many societies around the world. Because of biological and cross-cultural increased awareness, more and more people feel free to live openly and to stand up for their rights as people whose identity is both mentally sound and authentic. There has not suddenly been an increase in transgender folks, either—simply an increase in people who feel safe being themselves. The more we, as societies and communities, come to understand this idea, the safer—both physically and emotionally—the world can be for our trans siblings and people of all gender identities and expressions.</p>

	<h1>What is Gender Fluid Clothing?</h1>

	<h2>Gender fluid fashion is undefined.</h2>

	<p>It can mean different things depending on whom you ask, lacking a single, established construct. In fact, fashion industry experts say a truly gender-fluid outfit isn’t an outfit at all. It’s more a state of mind, fashionably speaking.</p>

	<p>“Gender-fluid or gender-inclusive clothing can be any clothing, in theory,” said Nick Paget, a senior analyst at World Global Style Network (WGSN), a global trend forecasting company that analyzes consumer shopping behavior. “The notion that clothing as an expression of our personality belongs to one gender is the social construct that needs disassembling.”</p>

	<p>In the past decade, fashion brands have increasingly produced gender-fluid collections to meet consumer demand: In 2019, 56 percent of Gen Z consumers shopped “outside their assigned gendered area,” according to Rob Smith, founder of the “gender free fashion” brand Phluid Project.</p>

	<p>You might see these collections under monikers like gender-neutral, androgynous, unisex, non-binary and so on. But experts say such initiatives, even when well-intentioned, often fall victim to performative activism. For one, many of those retailers that offer gender-fluid collections still separate their store offerings by gender. What’s more, these pieces tend to collapse gender expression into neutral colored and baggy sweats or T-shirts, experts told us.</p>

	<p>“I would say that gender-fluid dressing, like unisex dressing before it, is often self-fashioned and self-constructed,” explained Jessica Glasscock, a former researcher at the Metropolitan Museum of Art’s Costume Institute and a lecturer at Parsons School of Design. “[That] those fashion designers engaged with it and contribute to the visibility of the identity is wonderful, but I don’t know if they are leading the charge.”</p>

	<p>However, the notion of gender-fluid clothing is popular and shoppers do increasingly search for these collections (and around the concept itself). So if you’re looking to find some of these collections, you may get turned around by the many marketing campaigns claiming gender-fluidity for clothes that are anything but. To help guide your shopping and decipher the sometimes amorphous universe of these clothing collections, we spoke to fashion historians, gender scholars and even brands themselves, from global juggernauts like Adidas to smaller purveyors like TomboyX.</p>

	<h2>So, what is gender neutral clothing?</h2>

	<p>Gender-fluid clothing has no agreed-upon definition in the fashion industry—it’s easier to explain its purpose. In essence, gender-fluid fashion isn’t limited by the traditional “menswear” and “womenswear” binary. Instead, the idea is that any given outfit completely disregards the association between pants and men, skirts and women and so on. In fact, some experts say gender-fluid clothing has little, if anything, to do with the brands, designers and retailers that create them. Instead, they argue, any piece of apparel can be gender-fluid if its wearer so chooses.</p>

	<p>“I think about a place that sells jeans, like Levi’s: If I went in and am just looking for a certain cut and a certain size, I would go for that cut and size whether or not it said ‘men’s’ or ‘women’s’ over it,” said Nalo Zidan, a Black masculinities scholar and a designer for Yazi Clothing. “It’s because I’m looking for a particular fit to my body to help me express my sense of style. A designer’s focus should be getting the clothes on bodies to be right in relation to sizing.”</p>

	<h2>The Gender Neutral Fit</h2>

	<p>Brands that place special attention on fit—and refrain from splitting their collections into genders binaries—show genuine interest in their consumers. Zidan referenced TomboyX, where the fit and sizing process is key to the brand’s identity. Fran Dunaway initially started the company when she couldn’t find comfortable boxers for herself—TomboyX offers “gender neutral” undergarments.</p>

	<p>“A lot of times, companies start with Zero or Size Two, and then they use an algorithm to grade,” explained Dunaway, noting how one design spec informs another spec via some calculation or another. “Rather than just using an algorithm, we brought real customers in and real fit models and measured on different body types.” TomboyX’s “fit-tested on all body types” approach means the company fits undergarments on the bodies of “cis-female, cis-male and all of the different genders and a spectrum of identities” and compiles the data to create their sizes. By deemphasizing gender, they may better embody what it means to be a gender fluid company, Zidan told us.</p>

	<p>To execute this fit method, TomboyX “reaches out to people in the community” and pays them to come in and wear their clothes. “We spend a good six months back and forth with our pattern maker, bringing real people in of varying sizes, and then tweaking the designs,” Dunaway said.</p>

	<p>This practice isn’t necessarily common, said Lynn Boorady, MD, Head of Oklahoma State University’s design, housing and merchandising department. “Most companies are used to a proportional grading system in which if you grade the bust by 1,” you grade the waist and hips by the same proportion each time,” she explained.</p>

	<p>Simply put, this means most fashion brands will use a computer-generated formula based on traditional male and female proportions to size, a gendered approach to clothing design—experts consistently note the importance of sizing specifically in regard to gender-fluid garments. But not all retailers are forthcoming about what’s behind collections in the space. When we asked British fashion retailer ASOS about their sizing process and base patterns for their “unisex” collection COLLUSION, they acknowledged that “size inclusivity is important to use to be able to offer product to a broad range of our customers,” but declined to comment further. For brands like TomboyX, a mainstay value is asserting that “gender expression is not an afterthought.”</p>

	<p>Dunaway emphasized:</p>

	<p>“It’s the initial thought. It’s how we rolled out of the gate,” Dunaway said. “It turns out if you get the fit and the quality right and you use the right fabrics, it works for any and every body.”</p>

	<p>Harris Reed—who stands six feet nine in five-inch platform boots—dreams big. The 24-year-old designer, who identifies as gender-fluid, outfitted Harry Styles with a world tour’s worth of lamé pussy-bow blouses and worked on Gucci’s design team, all while he was a student at the London art and design school Central Saint Martins. When the pandemic canceled the graduate showcase this past May, he found a way to reach an even bigger audience by creating a giant disc hat filter on Instagram, “worn” by Kaia Gerber, Jeremy O. Harris, Kiernan Shipka, and more than a million other fans. “I’d like to eradicate the categories of menswear and womenswear,” Reed says. “Fluidity offers an alternate way of being, crossing and merging masculine and feminine.”</p>

	<p>Reed’s design philosophy takes further ideas about gender that are just starting to show up on the runways. Models identifying as non-binary, trans men, and cis men walked alongside cis women at Valentino’s Fall 2020 womenswear show. Agender model Juno Mitchell walked that show too, as well as for Eckhaus Latta, Marni, Coperni, Alexander McQueen, and Marc Jacobs, where they strode side by side with Miley Cyrus—who has described herself as gender-neutral—adding to the feeling that gendered clothing is increasingly irrelevant. “It’s just so not that period in time anymore,” says Marc Jacobs. “And for me, it hasn’t really been ever.” In September, Jacobs introduced Heaven, a new range billed as being for “girls who are boys and boys who are girls, [and] those who are neither.” Around the same time, Alessandro Michele launched Gucci MX, a new way to shop on Gucci.com, where pieces from his womenswear and menswear shows are merchandised together. “We are witnessing a ‘gender shift,’ ” says Stefano Pilati, creative director of Yves Saint Laurent from 2004 to 2012, explaining the origins of Random Identities, his Berlin-based louche glamour-meets-haberdashery line. “I therefore design fashion at the service of it.”</p>

	<p>More than half of Gen Z customers shop from both menswear and womenswear offerings, according to a recent survey by the New York–based brand consultancy Wunderman Thompson. While it’s true that fashion has a long history of subverting gender norms—think of Coco Chanel’s wide-legged trousers, Yves Saint Laurent’s le smoking, and Jean Paul Gaultier’s men’s skirting—by and large these designs have been created by people, and for people, who identify as cisgender. Until recently the industry had been slow to adapt to and embrace a more expansive definition of gender itself and a consumer who identifies across a gender spectrum. What sets young creatives like Reed and his contemporaries apart, then, is that they are designing for their own non-cisgender bodies and celebrating the communities that power their brands by putting them front and center.</p>

	<p>Pierre Davis, the 30-year-old cofounder and head designer of the L.A.-based collective No Sesso (Italian for “no gender”) creates conceptual pieces such as skirts made from suit jackets that showcase fluid possibility. Last year, Davis became the first trans woman to present a collection on the official New York Fashion Week calendar. “No Sesso started as just us making things that we see ourselves wearing, and our community really related to that,” says Davis. “It’s important that we continue to show our clothes on Black trans, queer, and non-binary people.”</p>

	<p>Art School’s 26-year-old non-binary creative director, Eden Loweth, made a brilliantly simple technical innovation: using a bias cut in tailoring. “As a trans person goes through hormone treatments, it changes the way that fabric sits on their body,” says Loweth, explaining the utility of a construction technique normally used to give silk dresses stretch. The London-based label’s blazers have also found fans in unlikely corners—cue the amputee mountain climber and local U.K. politician who walked with young trans and non-binary creatives in the most recent show. “You don’t need to be trans to understand what it’s like for your body to change shape over time,” Loweth adds.</p>

	<p>Loweth’s work has also won over MatchesFashion, which welcomed Art School and Harris Reed to its Innovators incubator program this fall. “We spend a long time searching for a diverse curation of design talent that will appeal to our global customers across genders,” says Natalie Kingham, fashion and buying director at MatchesFashion. Working with the luxury retailer gave Reed unexpected insight into his base. “I have guys, I have women, I have transgender people,” he says. “I have 50-year-olds in New York and 14-year-olds in Dubai. It could not be more all over the place, in the best way possible.” Next on his agenda for making the world more beautiful and inclusive is reimagining bridal. “My message is self-expression and just owning who you are in the biggest, most maximal way possible,” says Reed. “I think the potential reach for gender-fluid fashion really is everyone.”</p>

<!-- How Gender Fluidity Influences the Fashion Industry -->

	<h1>How Gender Fluidity Influences the Fashion Industry</h1>
	<span class="subtitle">Demetrius Williams</span>
	<br><span class="subtitle">August 2021</span>

	<p>The shifting landscape of gender seems to be one of the defining social issues of our time. In many developed markets, there are signs of increased respect and understanding of people reporting a non-binary gender identity, and more and more people reporting that they no longer adhere to traditional concepts of gender. Gender norms are shifting, and society along with it.</p>

	<p>A million Americans are now thought to identify as nonbinary. Several high-profile celebrities are advocating their own gender fluidity, which has helped drive uptake of the they/them pronoun in public discourse.</p>

	<p>Some brands, including Facebook and big banks, have taken steps to accommodate different genders and pronouns. There have also been moves at administrative levels to improve the way gender identity is formalised, such as the UK’s decision to make it cheaper to change your legal gender, although there’s still quite some way to go on this in most countries.</p>

	<p>There’s evidence that younger generations are particularly open to the idea of non-binary gender identities. Half of very young consumers—those in their teens and early twenties—agree that traditional gender roles and binary gender labels are outdated.</p>

	<p>Consumers under 40 agree in even higher numbers. One study in the US found around a quarter of the youngest consumers identify as non-binary; only 7.4% of those over 55 identified this way. The same study found that younger people tended to have more complex gender identities.</p>

	<p>The oldest people studied were the most likely to have a male-to-female gender identity whilst younger respondents had more varied identities. This study also identified that people tended to discover their gender identity at an increasingly younger age.</p>

	<p>Fashion tends to be driven by the social and political culture of the younger generation of consumers. It’s perhaps because younger consumers are increasingly inclined to challenge binary concepts of gender (and in turn, embrace gender fluidity) that we’re seeing that attitude reflected in fashion trends. While non-binary clothing may not appeal to all consumers, it’s likely to be highly influential across fashion in general.</p>

	<p>Children’s clothing retailers in particular need to pay attention to shifting attitudes to gender because it’s younger consumers that are becoming parents. As new generations of consumers start to buy children’s clothing and toys, their gender approach starts to become increasingly important to childrenswear retailers.</p>

	<h2>A Move to the Mainstream</h2>

	<p>Retail and fashion aren’t unaccustomed to gender-related pressures and social campaigns. For years there have been ongoing campaigns for toy stores to drop gender-based sorting of toys and for kids’ clothing stores to step away from pink/blue dichotomies and offer dinosaur t-shirts to any kid that wants one, regardless of their gender.</p>

	<p>Brands are now starting to see interest in adult clothing that moves away from gender binary divisions, and it’s becoming more mainstream. It seems that, unlike asymmetric hemlines or even skinny jeans, this could be a fashion movement that really endures.</p>

	<p>Gender-neutral clothing has been available for a long time but it’s tended to be pretty niche or high-concept. 30 years ago, high-end designers such as Yohji Yamamoto offered what was then called ‘unisex’ clothing for a fairly well-off clientele. These days things are different.</p>

	<p>For starters, we tend to talk about gender-neutral, gender-nonconforming, or gender-inclusive clothing rather than unisex clothing. The brands that are embracing gender fluidity through this way of dressing tend to be more mainstream and possibly a bit younger than in the past.</p>

	<p>The audience isn’t a small number of wealthy architects based in Central London or New York who admire utilitarian Japanese design. This time around, it’s pretty mainstream brands such as ASOS and Abercrombie & Fitch and via partnerships with huge retailers such as Target.</p>

	<p>It’s also more colourful. In the past, unisex clothing has often tended to be colour-neutral as well as gender-neutral, whilst the new generation of gender-inclusive clothing takes all the colours of the LGTBQ+ flag and runs with it.</p>

	<p>While there’s still gender-inclusive clothing that continues that colourless, utilitarian approach that’s characterized unisex clothing in the past, this tends to be at the higher-end. The gender-inclusive trends that are hitting the mainstream—and sold by mainstream retailers—tend to be colour blocked or multi-coloured.</p>

	<p>Some of the newer brands offering non-binary clothing include Wildfang, Kirrin Finch, and Britain’s own GFW. These brands all tend to share the same characteristics—they tell a good story based on the founders’ own experiences of gender fluidity and feeling excluded from the fashion world.</p>

	<p>They are strikingly inclusive, using models of all ages, abilities, shapes and sizes (and of course, gender identities). They emphasize fit and communicate this well to an audience that’s struggled in the past with finding clothing that reflects their identity but also fits properly. Often they take an innovative approach to describing cuts and sizing. GFW offers different styles of shirts based on whether you have an apple or pear-shaped body, for example.</p>

	<p>There’s also a strong overlap between modern gender-inclusive clothing and ethical, sustainable consumption preferences. The new generation of gender diverse fashion brands also boast of ethical working practices, and improved sustainability approaches such as plastic-free buttons, recycled polyester fabrics and responsible dyes.</p>

	<p>There’s less emphasis on disposable fashion and more on fit and durability. High-end fashion designer Riley studio even offers a lifetime guarantee on their garments. The new, smaller brands communicate their beliefs well and their audience tends to respond passionately.</p>

	<p>For bigger, more established brands trying to get in on the gender-diverse clothing scene, it’s hard to replicate that type of community and that type of passion.</p>

	<p>Perhaps that’s why gender-inclusive fashion has been so successful at penetrating the mainstream. New entrant brands that have popped up in the last few years have really shown mainstream retail how to effectively cover modern consumer passions such as sustainability, inclusivity, and community-building.</p>

	<p>They’ve shown real innovation in areas such as offering customers a better fit. They’ve put making the customer feel accepted and cherished right at the heart of the customer proposition and they may even manage to engage customers who previously felt written off by the fashion industry.</p>

	<h2>Hope for the Industry</h2>

	<p>With the retail industry experiencing crisis-level challenges, perhaps this offers a new direction that could give hope to struggling brands. Retail is currently being tested on a number of levels. For starters, there’s the pandemic and associated lockdowns which have led to a complete loss of footfall.</p>

	<p>Even before the coronavirus, there were myriad operating difficulties including low margins, strong competition, high rents, the rise of eCommerce and the challenges associated with catering to fickle, demanding customers.</p>

	<p>What opportunity is there for clothing retailers in this new era of non-binary clothing?</p>

	<p>Perhaps the real hope is that this is the seismic shift that could revitalize the fashion industry and define the era. We’ve not seen a truly massive rethink of fashion for some time now. If the non-binary trend heralded a new fashion movement as big as the move to power dressing in the eighties, we’d see customers making a major overhaul of their wardrobes. This would inject significant cash into a struggling industry just at the point when it desperately needs a flood of customers into stores.</p>

	<p>A less enormous but still very welcome effect could be that the new trend simply brings new interest in clothing from neglected customers. If enough consumers feel inspired to adopt the new, fairly radical change in the way they dress, this could increase sales.</p>

	<p>If retailers can bring back consumers that previously felt fashion wasn’t for them, they’re essentially finding new audiences. There could be a large untapped body of customers who’d previously given up in despair at not being able to get clothing that reflects their needs or fits their body shape. If they feel energized to re-engage with the industry, it could give a much-needed boost in these cruel times.</p>

	<h2>Disruptive Impact</h2>

	<p>The fashion industry is one that’s perpetually positive and always looks to the future. Whilst change is a constant in fashion, it’s the pace of this change that can be part of the problem for this industry.</p>

	<p>We’ve already noticed that the brands that thrive are those that are the most adaptive. That’s why some of the worst casualties of the recent tumultuous times have been the least flexible, traditional retailers.</p>

	<p>This has particularly included those with a heavy commitment to expensive retail space and a less high-profile web offering, such as department stores. Brands that now find themselves with a rigidly gender-segregated offering may suddenly find themselves looking dated and may also struggle to rapidly pivot to adapt to a new gender approach.</p>

	<p>Brands may also find themselves confronted with a choice whether to risk alienating established customers by reaching out to ones with a radically different approach to their bodies and their identity.</p>

	<p>Attitudes to gender identity, and gender fluidity, in particular, can be highly divisive. While younger customers seem the most inclined to embrace gender diversity, older customers may not relate to these issues. Even if they don’t have strong social views on gender identity, many consumers are set in their ways when it comes to shopping along gender-segregated lines and using sizing they’ve come to understand.</p>

	<p>With many brands trying desperately to cling onto established consumers it’s a real risk trying to retain these while still adapting to new ideas about society.</p>

	<p>Whilst there’s always hope that a major new trend could revitalise retail in these challenging times, it could also add further pressure to an industry that’s already struggling. If gender-diverse clothing turns into a major trend, it’s likely that not all retailers will be equally affected.</p>

	<p>As usual, it will favour the most nimble operators. It’s likely to be most advantageous to those with a younger custom base, while those with a more mature customer may struggle to know how to keep up with the times whilst still serving their base.</p>

	<h2>Cultural Differences</h2>

	<p>Although consumers in Western markets are showing interest in gender fluidity and associated social issues, many markets are nowhere near this mindset. Gender diversity is a much harder sell in more socially conservative markets and may simply not be an appealing proposition for many customers.</p>

	<p>This may be true for some Asian and Middle Eastern markets that are otherwise open to fashion trends. In such markets, gender-neutral clothing may only be of interest to a small number of consumers.</p>

	<p>But things change fast in modern societies. Even markets that may seem currently hostile to questions of gender identity may change those attitudes rapidly. Western brands that are penetrating socially conservative markets may find they need to adapt their offering to take into account local attitudes to gender expression. They’ll need to take an approach to gender expression that chimes with that culture at that particular point in time.</p>

	<p>These last few years, it seems as though retail keeps getting thrown curve balls by an ever-more challenging operating environment. The rise in conversations surrounding gender fluidity and gender-diverse dressing is just another symptom of fast societal change being expressed by changing consumer needs.</p>

	<p>Retailers can sometimes benefit from these challenges by adapting more effectively than their competitors to the opportunities they bring.</p>

	<p>Some retailers are blessed with particular advantages—brands with a younger more progressive consumer base may be able to adapt to these changes more easily. Some will find the challenges more onerous than others. Inevitably there will be winners and losers as retail scrambles to adapt to societal change in attitudes to gender identity.</p>

	<h1>Gender Fluidity on the Runways</h1>
	<span class="subtitle">Susan Chira</span>	
	<br><span class="subtitle">February 2017</span>	
	
	<p>Watching male and female models stride down the runways in tandem as more designers combined their women’s and men’s collections this New York Fashion Week raised the questions of what is masculine and what is feminine, how much those distinctions matter, and who gets to decide.</p>

	<p>Depending on which show you viewed, you could’ve been shown that it’s fine for men to sport blue feather boas or fishnet shirts with a bow (Jeremy Scott). Or for women and men to wear virtually interchangeable clothes, in restrained, minimalist androgyny (Raf Simons for Calvin Klein). Or for women to feminize the puffer by wearing it off the shoulder, cinched at the waist (Public School)</p>

	<p>Society is in a time of renewed ferment about gender. Culture wars rage over bathrooms and even the very notion that men or women have to choose one fixed gender identity. President Donald J. Trump reportedly likes his female staff “to dress like women”; just what this means isn’t entirely clear. The divide looms between those who welcome the new fluidity and those who yearn for clearly defined gender roles. So designers on the runway this week engaged in a continuing dialogue about how clothing defines masculinity and femininity—and how it scrambles these notions, too.</p>

	<p>Fashion has crossed many of these lines for years, of course. Women have long appropriated men’s clothes for comfort and authority. In the 1960s, longhaired men in paisley, florals and bell-bottoms defied conventions of what men were supposed to look like and what clothes they were supposed to wear. Jean Paul Gaultier put a man in a skirt back in 1984. </p>

	<p>And last year, Jaden Smith wore clothes designed for women in a Louis Vuitton’s SS16 advertisement. </p>

	<p>But showing the women’s and men’s lines together allowed for rapid-fire consideration of what the differences were, really. Material? Designers used the same fabrics for many of the men’s and women’s collections. Cut? In some cases, the tailoring seemed uncannily similar. Accessories? Many designers included accessories that once would have been thought exclusively feminine or masculine on both male and female models.</p>

	<p>Fashion, like society, is clearly not opting for hard and fast rules. Yet each designer has brought a particular sensibility to the gender continuum.</p>

	<p>Raf Simons made his name in men’s wear before expanding to women’s clothing. His first collection for Calvin Klein was also the first time the house showed both men’s and women’s lines in the same show. Mr. Simons was known for a distinctive male model, skinny and less bulked up, and he has said he designed some of his distinctive slim-shouldered suits for that physique.</p>

	<p>In this show, the men’s and women’s clothing looked all but identical; there were times when it was hard to figure out if the model was a man or a woman.</p>

	<p>Glen plaid suits with double-breasted blazers and black leather jackets with silver rose cutouts for men and women. Marching-band pants and varsity stripe motifs were echoed in the men’s and women’s clothes. Mr. Simons played with the idea of transparency: women in sheer tops showing nipples; men in sheer tops showing theirs.</p>

	<p>But he did not overtly cross gender lines by putting men in skirts. And he showed some simply beautiful feminine clothes, such as the dresses made of feathers encased in sheer plastic.</p>

	<p>For Public School, designers Dao-Yi Chow and Maxwell Osborne took street motifs often associated with men—parkas, puffers, hoodies, anoraks—and toyed with how to dress women in them. The off-the-shoulder puffers for women were a surprisingly sensual look for a normally unisex coat; the men in the show wore the puffers short and cropped, not oversized or baggy.</p>

	<p>As with the other runway shows, combining men and women allowed the designers to present one aesthetic and show how it applied to each gender. At Public School, a man walked out in a plaid shirt and slightly baggy pants with a zipper, followed by a woman wearing the same plaid shirt as a dress with a navy train. A man wore an oversize glen paid top; a woman wore the same glen plaid ensemble but belted and draped more closely to her body.</p>

	<p>Generally, the men’s and women’s looks were not interchangeable; rather, men were in recognizable men’s clothes, and women were more often in dresses and skirts, with bare shoulders and material gathered in artful folds. It was a brasher vision than Calvin Klein’s, further along the continuum of sexual distinction.</p>

	<p>eremy Scott had it both ways: gender traditional in his unabashed sexuality for women, and non-conforming in his use of what were once thought of as feminine colors, styles and accessories for men. Many of his designs for women were sex kittenish, including baby doll dresses, fishnet stockings, go-go boots, pink knit short shorts, and clingy tops in silver lamé. Men wore styles and colors that used to be associated with femininity including clingy velour pants in fuchsia and purple or jackets with gold fringe and purple sleeves.</p>

	<p>And sometimes Mr. Scott drew inspiration from both tropes in one look: He sent out a male model in a plaid skirt worn like a tunic over ripped jeans, finished off with an oversize parka. Men and women wore his signature Jesus motif coats with leopard accents—the women’s coats tighter, the men’s looser.</p>

	<p>In the end, designers ran the gamut, from blurring the lines between men and women to embracing them, sometimes in the same collection. It may be that fashion’s refusal to decide, to render any one verdict, is as radical as some of the more overtly political statements made this week on the runways.</p>

	<h1>The Meaning of Gender Fluid Fashion</h1>
	<span class="subtitle">Wren Sanders</span>
	<br><span class="subtitle">August 2019</span>

	<!-- add links to the brands to note section -->
	
	<p>Ever since Jaden Smith wore that Louis Vuitton skirt, I’ve read more articles about fashion’s so-called “gender-fluid movement” than I can count. I’ve read listicles that proclaim gender-bending style as fashion’s future, interviews in which designers proudly describe their binary-busting bona fides, op-eds pointing to gender fluidity as an antidote to toxic masculinity, as well as plenty of reviews playfully hailing the disruptive potential of men wearing this and women wearing that. Having read enough of these pieces, it would seem we are living in an unprecedented period of gender upheaval, a time when traditional expectations of what constitutes men’s and women’s dress are being blended, blurred, even reimagined altogether. Of course, this isn’t entirely the case.</p>

	<p>What we now call gender-bending fashion has existed as long as there have been gender norms to bend—which is to say, long before Jaden’s 2016 moment. Yet, even if not necessarily new, something about today’s fixation with fluidity feels different—at once more substantial and politically engaged. More than ever, the gender-bending we’ve grown accustomed to seeing on the runway is accompanied by a growing awareness of and sensitivity to the experiences of trans and gender non-conforming (trans&gnc) individuals—people for whom the bending of gender is not merely a style, but an identity.</p>

	<p>In fact, I identify as such a person; more specifically, as non-binary and transfeminine, terms I’ve chosen to describe myself as someone who generally presents more femme, though prefers not to locate their selfhood in terms of the traditional male/female divide. Because fashion has always been one of the most useful tools for carving a space for myself to experiment with my identity, I’ve been thrilled to see more brands thinking critically, publicly, and creatively about their relationship to gender. But, as with any instance in which queerness is rendered to serve commercial purposes, I’ve wondered: What’s at stake? And what might be gained for my community through mainstream fashion’s involvement in the larger cultural “gender-fluid movement”?</p>

	<p>According to model and trans activist, Ava Grey, one way the gender-fluid movement in fashion could help our culture engage in this necessary reorientation is through emboldening more trans&gnc representation. “When queer-identifying youth see queer representation on the runway and in media, we become symbols of hope for them,” says Grey. “We show them lives that have been able to move past the constant bullying and negative statistics.”</p>

	<p>Echoing the appeal to the benefits of increased representation is Charles Jeffrey, designer of the fearlessly avant-garde label, Charles Jeffrey Loverboy. Jeffrey, who doesn’t identify as trans himself, nevertheless brings one of the most ruthless attitudes toward binary definitions of gender in current design. “I think the positives of a bigger global conversation about gender outweigh any negatives,” he told me via email, adding: “From what I’ve seen in culture, in and outside of fashion, there’s indisputably more diversity, inclusivity and also information about trans and gender-non-confirming people. It’s real—real people, being able to give themselves their own platform to communicate their journeys.”</p>

	<p>But as Munroe Bergdorf points out, trans-inclusive casting is just the beginning. “What we need to be doing is making sure that fashion is as inclusive behind the scenes as it is in front of the camera or on the runway.” According to Bergdorf (who recently founded GODDESS, an online platform geared toward community building among women, trans and non-binary folks, and people who are intersex) ensuring that the recent mainstream interest in gender fluidity outlives its trendy status requires an appreciation that “trans people are more than just trans and can be part of a team, can be part of a project without their transness being the focal point, or even an issue for other people”.</p>

	<p>Even while creating opportunities for greater representation, large companies’ involvement in today’s gender-fluid movement risks overshadowing the work of more authentic, community-oriented labels. Art School’s Eden Loweth goes so far as to contend that there are two gender-fluid movements: one constituted by the bandwagon-hopping large and small houses, and another composed of labels like their own, or Davis’s No Sesso, brands that emerged from the trans&gnc community and involve them from the studio, to the runway, to the store.</p>

	<p>For Loweth, gender-fluid fashion is anything but a trend. It’s their work and life. It is about honoring and supporting their community, not, as they tell me, “monetizing something that is almost day-to-day hate for people like me on the streets.</p>

	<p>When I moved to London, trans women were a major force in my life that really protected me as quite a naïve young person living in a really big city,” they add. “Having those women involved in the actual process of us doing fittings is so informative, because they all have their own requirements. Their bodies are changing almost daily if they’re on hormone treatment, and that’s the basis of where we started working out what we wanted to do.”</p>

	<p>The effect of this authentic approach is clearest in the clothes, according to Munroe Bergdorf, who’s walked for Art School and has joined the designers in advocating for a non-binary option on official British documentation. “It’s more about the wearer and making sure that the clothing fits the body, not the body fits the clothes,” she says of the label. “Usually a dress would be made on a body to fit a mannequin essentially. And that’s why a lot of models look the same,” Bergdorf explains. “But they’ve taken into consideration the differences of trans bodies.”</p>

	<p>It is this level of concern—not only for how the clothes look, but also for what they mean to a wearer—that often seems lost on brands from Zara to Thom Browne, companies whose forays into questions of gender expression and identity pierce no deeper than a single collection or runway shows that present gender fluidity as the stuff of the avant-garde rather than the everyday. “Are these brands donating to these communities that inspire their runways?” No Sesso’s Pierre Davis asks, underscoring the opportunistic relationship between labels that benefit from the illusion of progressive politics without more robustly supporting the communities that influence their designs. “A lot of these big brands say that they’re designing gender-friendly clothing, but the margin that’s able to buy these pieces is just rich people,” she continues.</p>

	<p>And that’s assuming these brands intend to sell their more gender fluid pieces at all. Of course, the runway has always been a place for experimentation, yet there’s certainly something disingenuous when brands show collections that refute the binary before selling their clothes within the same divisive categories of men’s and womenswear that they’ve used for years. “For brands that want to almost use gender as a way of being provocative or exciting and contemporary, they’re not actually talking about the issues that matter,” says Bergdorf. “They’re taking the top line, which is trend, and not speaking about the realities, which is not fabulous all the time. It’s not fashion all the time. It’s survival.”</p>

	<p>Bergdorf is right. According to Stonewall, more than 4:5 trans youth have endured verbal abuse; 3:5 have endured threatening behavior; and nearly 40% have experienced physical assault. In many ways, to be trans in the world today is to live in danger and, understandably, in fear—a truth that strikes a sour note when told against the backdrop of a fashion industry that encourages pushing gendered boundaries without more robustly speaking out regarding the pervasive dangers associated with doing so. Indeed, one of the more concerning aspects of the fashion industry’s involvement in the gender-fluid movement is its propensity for conflating expression and identity, erasing trans&gnc people who don’t, or can’t, express their authentic selves safely.</p>

	<p>Mainstream fashion’s involvement in today’s gender-fluid movement has no doubt helped expand people’s perception of how men and women can dress. It has even exposed the public to a fuller picture of the whole constellation of genders with which one might identify. But if it is to earn a fraction of the political potency it has already seemed to claim for itself, the industry must not only continue to employ and celebrate its trans&gnc members, but also make a more substantial investment in the lives—and not simply the looks—of the broader trans&gnc community. “This is not just fashion,” says Pierre Davis. “This is a lifestyle and it needs to be taken seriously.”</p>

	<h1>The Need for Gender Fluidity in Fashion Beyond Pride</h1>
	<span class="subtitle">The Analyst Team</span>
	<br><span class="subtitle">June 2021</span>
	
	<p>Amongst the flurry of rainbow-themed merch dropping ahead of Pride, products advertised as “unisex” or “genderless” were popular across promotions. But with gender fluidity yet to be fully integrated into the fashion industry, are these long-overdue gestures for inclusivity or tokenistic attempts at wokeness?</p>

	<p>From androgynous influences on the runway to mass market retailers running “borrowed from the boys” clothing edits for women, the blurring lines of genders has been prominent in fashion for years. The unisex space is a fully realized market, yet that doesn’t mean it’s all-encompassing.</p>

	<p>Currently, retailers pitch shapeless and oversized garments as gender-inclusive, which according to Wren Sanders, “overlooks trans people who wear skirts and suits to affirm their identities.” Thereby ignoring the difference between gender-neutral and gender-fluid identity. With the increasing awareness of and sensitivity to the experiences of the trans and gender non-conforming (trans&gnc) communitiesxa, this is another area of the fashion industry that needs improvement.</p>

	<p>Ahead of Pride, notable retailers have launched capsule ranges advertised as “genderless” or “unisex,” propelling the market to new heights. We present the data findings of what this space currently looks like, the brands catering to it all-year-round and the influencers shattering gender norms.</p>

	<p>Reach out for a demo on how retailers are approaching sensitive issues such as gender fluidity and other changes in the market.</p>

	<h2>Gender Neutral Doesn't Always Mean Gender Fluid</h2>

	<p>It’s easy to see why this is an area of focus. According to the Phluid Project, 56% of Gen Z consumers shop outside of their assigned gendered area. Factoring in this cohort’s $143 billion spending power and the growth of the savvy consumer demanding diversity in fashion, it’s never been more timely for brands to promote an inclusive message with non-binary merchandise across all areas.</p>

	<p>But how inclusive is this market really? Despite the word “unisex” appearing dated in comparison to “genderless” and “gender-neutral,” the bulk of products online at mass and luxury brands are described with the former term, while the uses of “gender-fluid” or “gender-inclusive” are scarce.</p>

	<p>Following the events of last year, the fashion industry experienced a diversity awakening. Genderless products have spiked at mainstream retailers by 56% YoY. To prove it’s not just an after effect of COVID, we compared the number of products in stock now vs. pre-pandemic 2019 and spotted a 14% spike. And that’s just the tip of the iceberg. Brands with fluidity and inclusion ingrained in their inception avoid categorizing products by gender altogether.</p>

	<p>Consumers identifying as non gender-binary are reportedly spending the most on streetwear. Loungewear’s impact on streetwear echoes how mainstream retailers are investing in products to capture this demographic. Loungewear’s impact on streetwear echoes how mainstream retailers are investing in products to capture this demographic.</p>

	<p>For retailers using terminology that transcends genders, tops make up the majority of categories in stock in both regions.  T-shirts are the most invested style, equaling 51% and 47% of its parent category in the US and UK, respectively. Hoodies follow this at 21% in the US, versus sweatshirts at 17% in the UK. Genderless sweatpants also make up 36% of the bottoms category in the UK, while the US gives this product equal weighting with shorts at 33%. Overall, genderless outerwear is slightly more commonplace in the US market.</p>

	<p>As imagined, this market leans towards more dark and muted tones. Outside of white and black, blues and greys are the strongest tones invested across both regions. Neutrals are more prevalent in the US, while the UK is more invested in greens and pinks.</p>

	<p>To further the point that gender-neutral doesn’t always equal gender-inclusive, unisex products are predominantly graded in standard men’s sizing as the current psychology is women are more inclined to wear men’s clothing than vice versa. This mentality is still apparent in the fashion industry and proven through the product catering to this market. It is usually classified as either essentials, like jeans and tees, or sports and loungewear, which presents an opportunity to break down gender barriers through under indexed categories. Lingerie remains an untapped opportunity with those venturing in this space reaping the rewards, where gender-fluid label Les Girls Les Boys experienced a 400% YoY increase in underwear sales in 2020.</p>

	<p>Emails communicating unisex styles ramped up in September 2020 when PacSun launched a gender-neutral shop. Gap Factory, Rue La La and Polarn O. Pyret also contributed to the rise, sending out more emails towards the end of 2020 than earlier in the year.</p>

	<p>More retailers promoted genderless styles spanning apparel, footwear and accessories. Boohoo took the opportunity to highlight unisex collections associated with Pride month, while Scotch & Soda pushed genderless loungewear.</p>

	<h2>Social media has accelerated acceptance</h2>

	<p>As of March 2021, 25% of TikTok active users are aged 10 to 19, with 22.4% aged 20 to 29. TikTok has propelled non-conforming gender stereotypes into the mainstream with the “pronoun check” recently going viral on the platform, highlighting the use of multiple pronoun variations.</p>

	<p>Coined as “TikTok’s Best Dressed Guy” by Vogue, creator Wisdom Kaye is a leader in this space with 5.8 million followers, where platform boots by Rick Owens and Telfar bags both make an appearance in his videos. Other creators such as Jay Beech connect with his audience via gender-neutral, retro-inspired ensembles, while dresses and skirts are favored by Triple Minor.</p>

	<p>More social media platforms are expanding their inclusive features. In May, Instagram launched a spot for users to add pronouns to their accounts. Pinterest also offers the option of nine pronouns for users to choose from and add to their profiles.</p>

	<h2>Celebrities are leaning in</h2>

	<p>In May 2021, Demi Lovato announced they are non-binary, changing their pronouns to they/them. The singer shared the news alongside the launch of their new podcast, 4D With Demi.</p>

	<p>Celebrities including Lil Nas X and Kid Cudi have recently leveraged popular television shows to express their views on gender-conforming dressing. As a guest on the Jimmy Fallon show, Lil Nas X wore an oversized blazer from Virgil Abloh and a tartan skirt from Louis Vuitton, while Kid Cudi performed on SNL in a floral dress from Off-White - a tribute to Kurt Cobain.</p>

	<p>Breaking into the beauty space, Lil Yachty created a nail polish collection for all genders, with the first drop selling out in one day. Gender-fluid advocate Harry Styles is also rumored to be launching into the beauty space with a collection of perfumes and cosmetics.</p>

	<h2>Brands to note</h2>

	<p>This contemporary label handcrafts garments in Lahore, Pakistan in limited quantities to ensure meticulous attention to detail.</p>

	<h2>The end of traditional fashion culture </h2>

	<p>While the Fall 2021 womenswear runway shows were the most racially diverse season on record, representation across size, age and gender plummeted. According to the Fashion Spot’s diversity report, only 12 gender-diverse models walked in the Fall 2021 runway season versus  Spring 2021’s total of 20. The recent runway showcased non-binary models Parker Kit Hill and Richie Shazam hired by Christian Cowan, transgender model Ariel Nicholson who walked for Chloé and Gabriela Hearst, alongside Daniela Santiago booked by Roberto Cavalli.</p>

	<p>While brands are making strides to be more gender-inclusive, the microscope will be on their integrity going forward. How are they continuing this conversation and support in the future? Only time will tell, but what’s for certain is Gen Z’s collective $143 billion and unwavering loyalty will go to the businesses that pull up and champion inclusivity all year round. </p>

	<p>75% of Gen Z consumers would end relationships with companies that run campaigns perceived as macho, racist, or homophobic. That makes it imperative for executives to give BIPOC, trans and queer voices a seat at the table, paving the way for a more diverse and inclusive industry from the top down.</p>
